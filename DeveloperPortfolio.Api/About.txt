The steps to create this solution:

1. Create the Balzor WebAssembly project (later on referred to as Web).

2. Create the ASP.NET Core Web API project (later on referred to as Api).

3. Add the Entities folder to Api.

4. Add the following classes to the Entities folder in Api:
	- Project
	- Category
	- Tech
	- Link
	- ProjectTechRelation (used to associate projects with the technologies it uses)
	- ProjectLinkRelation (used to associate projects with the links that lead to Github, live pages, etc.)
